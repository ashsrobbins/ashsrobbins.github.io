        <p>
          This robot was made by myself as an experience to teach my fellow Tau Beta Pi members how to simply create a robot with inputs and outputs in order to test control algorithms in the real world.
        </p>
		<p>
			The total cost was ~$40, with the majority of the cost including the IMU, motors, and arduino microcontroller.
			A better video will be uploaded soon of the robot working well!

        <!--<span class="left"><img src="media/two_wheel.gif" alt="example graphic" height = 200 /></span>-->
        <p>
          Not officially a robot yet, but hopefully soon to be embodied. Ash-bot is a text based speech generator that is built from my facebook chat data. Phrases are generated with different diversity, making more unique(but less intelligible) sentences.
        </p>
		<p>
		Ash-bot was created using deep-learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks. Currently the model operates with letter embeddings(opposed to encoding words).
		</p>
		<p>
		<h4>Future tasks:</h4>
		<ul>
          <li>Bring in data from my texts, emails, etc.</li>
          <li>Host chat-bot on this site that can be interacted with</li>
		  <li>Give Ash-bot a robotic body, training through time(potentially with reinforcement learning where emotional valence of words modulate rewards) </li>
        </ul>
