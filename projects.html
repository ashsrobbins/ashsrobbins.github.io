        <p>
          This robot was made by myself as an experience to teach my fellow Tau Beta Pi members how to simply create a robot with inputs and outputs in order to test control algorithms in the real world.
        </p>
		<p>
			The total cost was ~$40, with the majority of the cost including the IMU, motors, and arduino microcontroller.
			A better video will be uploaded soon of the robot working well!

        <h1>Ash-bot</h1>
        <!--<span class="left"><img src="media/two_wheel.gif" alt="example graphic" height = 200 /></span>-->
        <p>
          Not officially a robot yet, but hopefully soon to be embodied. Ash-bot is a text based speech generator that is built from my facebook chat data. Phrases are generated with different diversity, making more unique(but less intelligible) sentences.
        </p>
		<p>
		Ash-bot was created using deep-learning, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks. Currently the model operates with letter embeddings(opposed to encoding words).
		</p>
		<p>
		<h4>Future tasks:</h4>
		<ul>
          <li>Bring in data from my texts, emails, etc.</li>
          <li>Host chat-bot on this site that can be interacted with</li>
		  <li>Give Ash-bot a robotic body, training through time(potentially with reinforcement learning where emotional valence of words modulate rewards) </li>
        </ul>

		<p>
A virtual reality application that allows for you to scan your clothes into a virtual closet. 
		</p>
		<p>
Pictures of clothes are cropped using computer vision to determine the edges.
</p>
Each picture is labelled using a pre-trained classification network, giving tags such as (red, dress) or (blue,shirt).
<p>
Initially, clothes are rendered in 2D and laid upon a 3D model, however topologically wrapping around the model is possible, or a 2D model too.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/218422794">Beyond Geek - Hackathon Preview</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/beyondgeek">Jowagi Productions</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
		</span>
		<p>
My team created a crowd-sourced phone application for note taking. Our team was a large focus during an episod of Beyond Geek, airing on PBS.
		</p>
		<p>
	Our goal was to allow college students and those interested in higher-level learning to share notes in an open manner. This would help further the ease and accessibility  knowledge.
	</p>
	<p>
	If someone desires to learn about organic chemistry, they can search and find "notebooks" of notes with similar tags, along with a rating system to help find high-quality results.
